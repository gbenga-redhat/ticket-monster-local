The value of the attribute is name of property which forms the other side of the relationship - in this case, not unsuprisingly show!

As Show is the owner of Performance (and without a show, a performance cannot exist), we add the cascade = ALL attribute to the @OneToMany annotation. As a result, any persistence operation that occurs on a show, will be propagated to itâ€™s performances. For example, if a show is removed, any associated performances will be removed as well.

When retrieving a show, we will also retrieve its associated performances by adding the fetch = EAGER
attribute to the @OneToMany annotation. 
This is a design decision which required careful consideration. In general, you should favour the default lazy initialization of collections: their content should be accessible on demand. However, in this case we intend to marshal the contents of the collection and pass it across the wire in the JAX-RS layer, after the entity has become detached, and cannot initialize its members on demand.
